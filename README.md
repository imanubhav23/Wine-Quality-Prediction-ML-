## Wine Quality Prediction

The task here is to predict the quality of red wine on a scale of 0â€“10 given a set of features as inputs.
I have solved it as a regression problem using Linear Regression.

The dataset used is Wine Quality Data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Input variables are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol. And the output variable (based on sensory data) is quality (score between 0 and 10).

The code is in python. Other than this, please install the following libraries using pip.
Pandas: pip install pandas
matplotlib: pip install matplotlib
numpy: pip install numpy
scikit-learn: pip install scikit-learn
